## Building a minified release

The repository does not contain a minified resrc.min.js file - this is only generated
for [RELEASES](https://github.com/resrcit/resrc.js/releases). To build your own minified copy
for use in development simply run ```npm install``` if you haven't already, followed by ```grunt build```.
This will generate a resrc.min.js file in the `dist` subdirectory.

## Team

resrc.js is actively developed by [Dom](https://github.com/domfee). [Ed](https://github.com/ejthurgo) works his magic server side, building the core engine.
