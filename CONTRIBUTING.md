## Submitting Pull Requests

**Please follow these basic steps to simplify pull request reviews - if you don't you'll probably just be asked to anyway.**

* Run ```npm install``` to make sure your development dependencies are up-to-date
* [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) >= 0.4.1 is required to sanity check your contribution
* Please ensure that resrc.js is lint free before submitting a PR by running:
* ```grunt build```
* If you've added new functionality, **please** include tests which validate its behaviour

## Submitting bug reports

* Where at all possible, please try and provide a link to a jsfiddle.net example or similar
